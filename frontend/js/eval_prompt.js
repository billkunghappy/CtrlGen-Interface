    Edit_0: 'When you\'re 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations" are deemed too high-risk. When you\'re 85, the side effects are finally discovered. People that have taken the drugs experience loss of intelligence. When they are 40, their minds are destroyed. This create a big problem to the society because lots of people with low IQ wander in the street causing many social problems and crimes. Worse still, these people won\'t die because they have no signs of aging. When they reach 85, their bodies begin to fail, but still will not die due to health problem. Since technology have not progressed, they are a burden for the society and have to live in a big city called the “Retirement Zone". The government has come up with a solution to solve this problem: the Death Game. In this game, the people that have taken the drug must fight for their lives in everyday life. Those who lose will be killed. The winner will become immortal.',
    Edit_1: 'Your entire life, you\'ve been told you\'re deathly allergic to bees. You\'ve always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say "Your Majesty, what are your orders?" I think to myself, "where is this voice coming from?  It can\'t be from this tiny creature I was taught to fear my whole life, could it?"\n\nI look down at the bee, and it looks back at me. In that instant, I began to realize that bees aren\'t these mean and scary creatures I was once taught to believe.  Buy why was it calling me "your majesty?"\n\nI look around, and I notice that I\'m not in my bedroom anymore.  I have been magically transported to a world that is covered in sweet golden perfection.  A world made of honeycomb walls and beehive furniture.  I was in a castle.  I was sitting in a throne.  Atop my head was a crown that was made with diamonds that shined brighter than the sun.  What is going on here???\n\nA voice booms from the ceiling, "Welcome, your majesty!  \n\nI reply, "Thank you.  But, why am I here.  I don\'t understand what is going on. "\n\n"Your majesty, you have been chosen to lead the bees. Your whole life you have been running from us.  But this whole time, we have been trying to find you.  You see, we are not scary and malicious insects that some people have lead you to see as the truth.  We are a group of insects that are kind, caring, and are just trying to pollinate the world so that we can continue to provide fruit and honey to all of earth\'s creatures.  You were chosen a long time ago as our queen, and now here you are."\n\nI look around the room, and I notice that there are thousands of bees surrounding me. To be honest, I am starting to feel quite flattered by all the attention.  I am also starting to feel a little bit more confident about my new role as queen. \n\nSometimes in life we are told that things are scary and bad.  However, in reality, they are much different.  We just have to be open to them.  And that is what I have realized.  So with my new found sense of respect for my bee friends, I lived happily every after as queen bee.\n\n',
    Edit_2: "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. He appears to be a gentle professor teaching in the college attended by the woman, thinking that it would impress her. But she's not impressed, and he's not going to give up. He's determined to make her love him, and he's willing to do whatever it takes. One day, he met the woman in the library. She was standing in front of a shelf, and he was standing behind her. He was about to approach her, when she suddenly turned around and looked at him. He was stunned by her beauty, and he couldn't believe his luck. He was so sure that he had finally found the woman of his dreams. He was so sure that this time, it was going to work out. But she didn't feel the same way. She was frightened by him, and she ran out of the library. He chased after her, and he was determined to make her love him. As the woman was running across the road, a car almost hit her! He then quickly pulled her back to the side walk and saved her life. She felt very grateful towards him and made friend with him. As time goes by, their friendship turned into a romantic relationship!",
    Edit_3: 'Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\nIt took a lot of scientists and people with old wisdom to unlock this hidden power and the secrets behind it. They figured out that while yes, the mana is spread very thinly, if people work together they can channel their mana power together, creating an amount large enough to allow someone to wield it and its incredible power.\nThe Mana-users are called “Mana-Senshi”, which literally translates to “Mana Warrior”. These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a “Mana Dispensary” and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked.\nAt first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. ' 
    + 'It wasn’t until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana.\nThe warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans’ favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors.\nAfter a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.\nSome rogue Warriors went into hiding and have not been located since. These Warriors are roaming the world somewhere, still holding this incredible power. Now that the aliens are gone, the real threat is alive and well; power hungry humans.\n',
